Welcome to the PrefixScript Install page!

Compilation and installation of PrefixScript is very straightforward, but you will
need the following things to proceed:

* A valid cmake installation (Version 3.1.0 or better)
* A valid copy of GNU Make or comparable
* A c++11 compiler (GCC, G++ and family)
* 3 minutes of time or more

If you have all of these, by all means, READ ON!

If not, you may want to go back and look into obtaining all the rest of the required
items from the list. If you are running Linux (which IMHO you should) then your distro's
package manager should be able to help you with finding most of the items above. If,
however, you are running Fedora or Ubuntu, you may need to install said package manager
in order to make this easy. This is because they use GNOME Software, which is very
limited from the standpoint of installing system libraries.

In order to find a package manager on Fedora:
* Open GNOME Software
* Search for Yumex
* Install Yum Extender (DNF)
NOTE: if the (DNF) is missing, and no version has it, don't worry, you're fine. Just
install the version you can.
* Run it when you're finished. Here you can browse everything you'll be likely to ever
need.

In order to find a package manager on Ubuntu:
* Open Ubuntu Software
* Search for Synaptic
* Install the Synaptic Package Manager
* Run it when you're finished. Here you can browse everything you'll be likely to ever
need.


* Create folder build inside the source folder
* open a terminal and cd to your new build folder
* Run cmake ..
* Address any errors CMake displays (if any)
* Run make
* Address any errors Make displays (if any)
* Run make test
* At this point, if you see any errors, either you aren't in {sourcedir}/build or there is
something wrong with either your copy of PrefixScript or your build system.
    - if this recurrs on other systems, file a bug.
* If there are no errors, run sudo make install
* You now have a copy of PrefixScript built and installed!

Refer to {sourcedir}/doc.html for API reference. The prefixscript command has been installed, and it is your new prefixscript interpreter. Have fun!


WARNING: Failiure to create the build directory will result in make test failing as well!
You have been warned!
