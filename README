Note: master is incomplete right now. Please refer to one of the release tags if you want to actually use PrefixScript at the moment.

WELCOME TO PREFIXSCRIPT!

PrefixScript is a lightweight scripting language written ONLY in base C++11. Advantages of PrefixScript include:

- Fast code: when a program is run it runs at almost native speed
- Rich documentation: just open doc.html and you've got a complete
	 reference for the entire language at your fingertips
- Simple memory management: PrefixScript works more like an RPN
	 calculator than a programming language. There is no need
	 to remember which variable name was used- just type pop!
- Multi-file functions: PrefixScript embeds each function in a new
	 file, with any and all arguments as values in the stack for
	 that program. Similar to Python, if it works alone, it works
	 as a function module

These are a small selection of the various features of PrefixScript.

In order to better demonstrate how simple PrefixScript is, here is an example script. It adds 4, 5, 6, and 7 and then displays the result and forgets it, freeing the memory used:

+ 4 5 6 7 /+
popn
^D

You can find this file in "example.presc" if you would like to run it yourself.

Note some build dependancies exist for the default build, these are not required. All that is really required is a c++11 compiler and a command line.

In order to run a basic install, it is reccommended that the following tools be installed:

 - CMake
 - GNU Make
 - g++ (or gcc-c++ etc.)

Compiling main.cpp with any c++11 compiler should yield similar results, but it will not allow for easy installation and further changes to be seamlessly made within the program without constantly recompiling the ENTIRE project.

Have fun!

<<<<<<< HEAD
Note that on this branch, there are a few features that haven't been added back yet.
It is a rewrite to address many issues with the original code that can't easily be fixed without a rewrite.

The current list of commands:
+
-
*
/
pop
popn
silentpop
top
topn
stack
c
print
input
sinput
linebreak
strpop
strpopn
strtop
strtopn
vcheck
return

Please refer to main.cc for additional commands as they appear.
Also note that while all of these commands work, not all features may work the same as they do in master. Please report any issues using the github issue tracker.

Thank you, and happy coding!
