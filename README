Welcome to PrefixScript!

Right now, the version is in pretty constant flux, so I'm not going
to presume that the version number is one thing or another. For now,
just read INSTALL for instructions on installing PrefixScript. Note
that the file doc.html is only useful once you have a working and
fully compiled copy of PrefixScript, as it is just an API reference
page.

Happy coding!
