/*
 * WELCOME TO PREFIXSCRIPT!
 * 
 * Right now PREFIXSCRIPT can do basic math with multiple
 * inputs using its main stack feature, print values and
 * text, and do basic formulas. All input is from stdin,
 * so there is no really excellent way to pipe a script file
 * to the program on Windows, to the knowledge of the author.
 * 
 * This is the main file, which contains the main loop and a
 * reference to the command runner in the next file.
 * 
 * Note that this is a WORK IN PROGRESS, and will probably
 * be vastly different, should it ever be completed.
 * 
 * Enjoy your copy of PREFIXSCRIPT!
